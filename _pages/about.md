Research Scientist specializing in AI applications for Music and Audio Processing with prior experience
in commercial audio product development with international and US patents. Proven track record of
driving innovative interdisciplinary research, and high-resource deep learning deployment.

I recently finished my PhD at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London on Time-domain Music Source Separation for Choirs and Chamber Ensembles. My research received the Best Student Paper Award at IEEE WASPAA 2023. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher on an Innovate UK project in collaboration with a couple of Music Tech startups.

I have previously developed VST audio plugins for cross-adaptive audio effects for live music using Csound at the Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London. I've also worked for Qualcomm on Audio Quality Testing Automation by developing audio analysis algorithms to quantify system level audio performance using perceptual metrics.
